PopcornAnalytics provides research-grade crypto OHLCV datasets, rebuilt directly from raw Kraken trade logs using a custom reconstruction pipeline.
All datasets follow the same strict accuracy rules:

Zero gaps (every minute reconstructed, including low-liquidity periods)

Millisecond timestamps (superior to standard API feeds)

True trade-derived OHLC (no API snapshot inaccuracies)

Perfect 1-minute alignment

Accurate base-currency volume

Verified using internal consistency checks

True raw-trade OHLC values

Delivered as .json (and .csv upon request)

ETHUSD is offered as a premium dataset due to its size, computational cost, and high demand from trading researchers.

📘 Dataset Format

Each 1-minute candle is stored as:
[
  timestamp_ms,   // Unix timestamp in milliseconds (UTC)
  open,           // Opening price
  high,           // Highest trade price
  low,            // Lowest trade price
  close,          // Closing price
  volume          // Base-currency traded volume
]

⚙️ How These Datasets Are Built

PopcornAnalytics uses a custom high-precision reconstruction engine:

Load raw Kraken trade logs

Sort trades and align by strict UNIX minute boundary

Derive OHLC from true tick-level sequence

Sum base-currency volume from actual trades

Fill missing minutes with zero-volume flat candles

Validate timestamp continuity & format correctness

Export as clean, analysis-ready JSON (CSV on request)

This process ensures perfect reproducibility, consistent structure across all pairs, and full transparency.
